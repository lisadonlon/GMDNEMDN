# Feature Management Documentation

This document explains the features that have been hidden from the production interface and how to re-enable them for development or future implementation.

## Hidden Features

### 1. ICD-10 Clinical Indications
**Status**: Hidden in production (set `icdClinicalIndications: false` in `config/features.ts`)

**What it does**: 
- Shows clinical indications (ICD-10 diagnostic codes) for medical devices
- Provides semantic relationships between device codes and clinical conditions
- Displays confidence scores and source attribution for mappings

**Why hidden**: 
- Data coverage is incomplete - many devices may not have established clinical mappings
- The semantic relationship system is still being refined
- User experience may be confusing with empty or sparse results

**How to re-enable**:
1. Set `icdClinicalIndications: true` in `config/features.ts`
2. Or call `enableDevelopmentFeatures()` function
3. Ensure semantic relationship data is properly loaded

**Components affected**:
- `GmdnDetailEnhanced.tsx` - Clinical Indications section
- `EmdnDetailEnhanced.tsx` - Clinical Indications section

### 2. ICD Search Components
**Status**: Not integrated into main app (set `icdSearch: false` in `config/features.ts`)

**What it does**:
- Standalone ICD-10 code browsing interface
- Search for medical devices by clinical condition
- Bidirectional lookup between diagnostic codes and devices

**Why hidden**:
- Not yet integrated into the main app navigation
- ICD data may need to be fetched/generated separately
- User workflow needs to be designed for proper integration

**How to re-enable**:
1. Set `icdSearch: true` in `config/features.ts`
2. Add ICD search component to main App.tsx navigation
3. Ensure ICD data is available (run `node fetch-and-chunk-icd.cjs` if needed)

**Components available**:
- `IcdSearch.tsx` - Basic ICD search
- `IcdSearchEnhanced.tsx` - Advanced ICD search with semantic relationships
- `IcdSearchSimple.tsx` - Simplified ICD search interface

### 3. External Resource Disclaimers
**Status**: Enabled with disclaimers (set `externalResources: true` in `config/features.ts`)

**What it does**:
- Provides links to external regulatory databases
- Searches for device information on international registries

**Current state**:
- Enabled but with prominent disclaimers about result relevance
- Warning users that external searches may not always return relevant results

### 4. Semantic Statistics
**Status**: Hidden (set `semanticStats: false` in `config/features.ts`)

**What it does**:
- Shows statistics about semantic relationship mappings
- Displays coverage metrics for ICD-device relationships

**Why hidden**:
- Statistics may be incomplete or misleading
- Not essential for core functionality

**How to re-enable**:
- Set `semanticStats: true` in `config/features.ts`

## Development vs Production Modes

### Development Mode
```typescript
import { enableDevelopmentFeatures } from './config/features';
enableDevelopmentFeatures();
```

Enables:
- ICD clinical indications
- ICD search components
- Semantic statistics
- Advanced search features
- Debug information

### Production Mode
```typescript
import { enableProductionFeatures } from './config/features';
enableProductionFeatures();
```

Enables only:
- External resources (with disclaimers)
- Core GMDN-EMDN mapping functionality

## Data Dependencies

### For ICD Features
- Semantic relationships data: `data/semanticRelationships.ts`
- ICD-10 lookup indices: `public/icd10-mappings/`
- ICD codes data: Run `node fetch-and-chunk-icd.cjs` to generate

### For External Mappings
- GMDN-EMDN mappings: `public/gmdn-emdn-mappings/`
- Generated by: `node create-gmdn-emdn-mappings.cjs`

## Future Implementation Notes

1. **ICD Integration**: Consider adding ICD search as a separate tab/view in the main app
2. **Data Completeness**: Expand semantic relationship coverage before full enablement
3. **User Testing**: Test hidden features with users before re-enabling
4. **Performance**: Monitor loading times with all features enabled

## Quick Feature Toggles

```typescript
// In any component that uses features
import { isFeatureEnabled } from '../config/features';

// Conditionally render features
{isFeatureEnabled('icdClinicalIndications') && (
  <IcdIndicationsComponent />
)}
```

This system allows for easy A/B testing and gradual feature rollout.
